			<a id = "title1">Positive Aspects</a>

				<ol id = "content1">
					<li>The movie stayed true to old characters/themes.  Han Solo felt like an older version of the Han we saw in Episode VI.  He still has a strong rebellios streak, a cocky attitude, and plenty of sarcastic comments.  Leia was still very resposible and willing to make hard desisions, such as letting her husband pull a stunt that she knew was dangerous.  Even without understanable dialoge, Chewbaaca still seemed like his old strong, mostly silent, and mildy grumpy personality.</li>
					<li>The characters were interesting/compelling.  This is the first time that a Star Wars movie even kind of showed the perspective of a stormtrooper.  With Finn, we can get some insigt into what being a First Order Stormtrooper is like while still being able to focus on heroic characters.  Rey also has an interesting character, even if her background is (at least for now) boring.  While BB-8 is no R2-D2, I still came to like him.</li>
					<li>It still felt like a Star Wars movie.  It had interesting aliens, various climates, lightsaber fights, space battles, the force, and powerful villains.  There were emotional moments (I cried both times I saw the movie.  You can probably guess where), exciting moments, and character building.</li>

			<a id = "title2">Negative Aspects</a>

				<ol id = "content2">
					<li>Tell me if this sounds familiar:  It opens with a droid recieving a document that the entire galaxy wants.  Menewhile, teenager is stuck on a desert planet and wants to leave.  The teenager and droid teem up.  On their adventures together the go to a cantina with odd aliens, loose a mentor to a Dark Side user, and meet up with the good guys. The climax is X-Wings and Y-Wings (and some other ships) attacking the week point of a spherical space station the tyranical enemies use to destroy planets.  If you are confused whether that was the plot to Episode IV or Episode VII, you should be.</li>
					<li>After the amazing lightsaber battles from Episode III, Rey's fight with Ren was dissapointing.  While it wasn't bad, it did feel like a step backwards.</li>
					<li>Episode VIII isn't out yet.</li>
					<li>Han............   Very Depressing.</li>

			<a id = "title3">Summary of my Opinion of Episode VII:</a>
			<p>
				Over all, Episode VII was amazing.  It managed to quell the doubts I had about Disney ruining the franchize and bring back the fans who hated the prequels.  While it did take a lot of plot points from Episode IV, it feels more like a move to say "We can do it right this time" to those who din't like the prequels.

			<a id = "title4">Current Theories about Episode 8</a>
			<ol id = "content4">
				<li>Many people are wondering if Snoke is Darth Plegius back from the dead.  The two look similar, Snoke has a lot of damage on his face (maybe from when Darth Sidious attacked him?), and Darth Plegius is still cannon as he is mentioned in Episode III.</li>
				<li>I have also heard the theory that Snoke is Darth Sidious.  Again, Snoke is badly damaged, and being thrown into space will definately damage a person.  Also, Darth Sidious was revived when his sith ghost went into clone of himself.</li>
				<li>Many people say that Rey is related to the Skywalkers.  As far as I can tell, the only solid evidence for this is that Star Wars has a history of making people surprisingly related, what with Luke being Anikin's son and Ren being Han and Leia's son.</li>
				<li>I have also heard the theory that Han is not dead.  I have heard no evidence for this whatsoever, and it is just wishful thinking.  However, I think that we can conclude that Han is alive (don't argue with me).</li>
